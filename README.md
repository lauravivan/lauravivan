# Hi! I'm Laura ☃️

## About me
🎓 Currently studying Information Systems at Instituto Federal de Santa Catarina (IFSC).

🩺 Participated in a university extension project to develop a web application that automates the triage process in health centers and hospitals using the Django framework.

👩‍🦯‍➡️ Currently developing a web system to simplify the understanding of WCAG accessibility guidelines. The system will also implement some of these guidelines, improving accessibility for a portion of users.

💵 Additionally, as a freelancer, I developed a web system focused on splitting payments between partners. The solution helps companies manage partners, services, and charges, allowing them to pay multiple partners in a single transaction. The system integrates with a payment API.

🦊 In my personal projects, I built a portfolio using Notion as a base, leveraging the Vue.js framework. I also started small projects to improve my skills in React.js and TypeScript.

## Portfolio
I've created a Notion-based portfolio to showcase my projects and personal information.
